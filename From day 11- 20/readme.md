> 4 June 2021 | day 11

Started with a small capston projet(Black jack)<br>
You can check the code here named* **day11_blackjack.py**<br>
The code itself is pretty simple, since i modified many rules like Ace is just 1 instead of not 1 and 11 at the smae time and even full deck will reamain same after dealing.<br>
I will come back to this project with with all rule intact later and I am even thinking about creating GUI for Black jack later, using tkinter or pygame. We will see and i will always keep this updated.<br>
